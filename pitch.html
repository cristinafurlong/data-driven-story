	    <p>There are over 5,000 School Safety officers who are hired as full time employees with full benefits and vacation. It is different for school crossing guards, who are not allowed to work over 20 hours a week. These numbers are not congruent with the rising number of violent traffic incidents in New York City.  </p> </p>

 While violence in schools is in decline,"Pedestrian deaths from vehicle strikes are quickly rising in New York City" according to a 2014 article by the New York Daily News.

 The budget allocates twice the amount of money for school safety as it does for traffic enforcement, in clear opposition of the growing trend.
 With the NYPD School Safety force being almost twice the size of Boston, and the most dangerous city in America, Detroit, there should be a way to balance the figures to ensure that children are kept safe from growing traffic violence in New York City.
