	    <p>Sadly, the Department of Education is taking advantage of its status as uninvited to the Vision Zero party, and when called to discuss wellness programs and safety for kids, I was directed to a list of programs for educators.>
	   
	    <p>There are over 5,000 School Safety officers who are hired as full time employees with full benefits and vacation. It is different for school crossing guards, who are not allowed to work over 20 hours a week. </p> </p>

		<p>School budget is another issue to research, as funding for individual schools is not standard and funding sources can be state, federal, by grant, or even private donation. Digging into the costs contracted out to the NYPD may reveal an amount worth further investigation.

		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
