<h2>Weapons or Walking? Which is more dangerous for NYC school kids? </h2>
<p>Though enforcement is up and safety education abounds, more attention is going to terror training and weapons prevention in schools.</p>

<cite>Source: Make Queens Safer. </cite>	    <p class="lead">In the last few years, some very high profile incidents of traffic violence injuring or killing school children, the Department of Education still spends far more dollars and resources on terror and violent crime and prevention over traffic safety lessons and staffing and street resources. (by this I mean developing pick up and drop off protocols, encouraging walking and biking to school).</p>

	    <p>Sadly, the Department of Education is taking advantage of its status as uninvited to the Vision Zero party, and when called to discuss wellness programs and safety for kids, I was directed to a list of programs for educators.>

	    <p>There are over 5,000 School Safety officers who are hired as full time employees with full benefits and vacation. It is different for school crossing guards, who are not allowed to work over 20 hours a week. One can find both types of agents on the streets of public schools at dismissal time. Why is it that the DOE and NYPD allow such disparity in job description and compensation?</p>
	    <p>We didn't talk much about <code>p</code>aragraphs, <code>blockquote</code>s or <code>a</code>nchors, but you'll need them if you don't want your content to run together in a great heap. You can wrap paragaphs in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags manually, but if you want some help with the basic pieces, I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a>. You can compose in Markdown, a heavily simplified syntax, and then copy the resulting HTML into a Bootstrap template. Markdown is a very basic language -- you can't do a lot with it, so you can focus on the basics. </p>

		<p>School budget is another issue to research, as funding for individual schools is not standard and funding sources can be state, federal, by grant, or even private donation. Digging into the costs contracted out to the NYPD may reveal an amount worth further investigation.

		<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
