<h2>Traffic Violence vs School Violence: Striking a balance </h2>
<p>With a NYPD school safety officer department with huge numbers, how much manpower is being devoted to keeping kids safe from motorists?</p>

	    <p>There are over 5,000 School Safety officers who are hired as full time employees with full benefits and vacation. It is different for school crossing guards, who are not allowed to work over 20 hours a week. These numbers are not congruent with the rising number of violent traffic incidents in New York City.  </p> </p>

A monumental and poweful report, Keeping Kids in School and Out of Court" was published for the New York City school justice partnership task force. The report notes that school suspensions were up 40% in six years, while violence in schools had dropped 37%, and that suspensions were not a function of serious misbehavior but that suspensions and arrest patterns were more a function of adult response. Restructuring the role, responsiblities and responses of school safety agents was listed as one of five recommendations of the task force. The report states, "The leadership team should focus the role of school safety officers and police on keeping schools safe and not as first responders to everyday school misbehavior." 		
 While violence in schools is in decline,"Pedestrian deaths from vehicle strikes are quickly rising in New York City" according to a 2014 article by the New York Daily News.

<p> The budget allocates twice the amount of money for school safety as it does for traffic enforcement, in clear opposition of the growing trend. According to the Center for Court Innovation, during the 2010-1011 school year, 72% of schools had no violent crime and 13% had only one violent crime. 
 With the NYPD School Safety force being almost twice the size of Boston, and the most dangerous city in America, Detroit, there should be a way to balance the figures to ensure that children are kept safe from growing traffic violence in New York City.  
 </p>
 <p>Changing school safety as it relates to pedestrian injury has been studied by Columbia University public health researchers. Implementing traffic safety improvements and interventions, Safe Routes to School programs, resulted in a 44% decrease in the injury rate of school aged children during school commute hours. However, only 135 of the city's 1800 schools have received such programs.

 <h2>Vision Zero funding neglects schools </h2>
 <p>According to the Fiscal 2015 Executive Budget of New York City, the NYPD has a $13.3 million dollar allocation for its role in the Mayor's Vision Zero Initiative. Included in that funding is $7.8 million to fund an additional 147 traffic enforcement agents and their ensuing overtime. They will be deployed to problematic intersections during evening and late night hours. No funds were allocated for crossing guards, either to increase their pay, which max's out at $14 an hour, vs. the $17 per hour for traffic enforcement agents, who have no attachment to schools.
